Behold: the only graphing calculator made for Series 80 devices. Original code by Emil Tchekov (for Psion 5 MX), but the porting and a couple of extra features was coded by me.

The most basic commands:
- exponent: x**n (e.g. 2^3 = 2**3)
- square root: sqr(x)
- sum: x+n
- substract: x-n
- multiply: x*n
- divide: x/n
- trigonometric functions: function(x) (e.g. sin(2))
